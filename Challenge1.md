## The code prints a sentence that says "Hello, [first_name], your favorite number is [favorite_number]." 
The values of first_name and favorite_number are inserted into the string dynamically using string concatenation.

```python
# Global Declaration
first_name = 'Gyan'
favorite_number = '9'

# Declaring varables to invoke print function
print('This is invoked using declared variables.')
print('Hello,', first_name + ', your favorite number is' ,  favorite_number + '.')
# Adding block differentiator
print("=" * 45)

# Asking the user for their name and favorite color
favorite_number = input('What is your favorite number? ')

# Printing out the message
print('This is invoked to retrieve input from user.')
print('Hello,', first_name + ', your favorite number is', favorite_number + '.')
# Adding block differentiator
print("=" * 45)
```

## Output

Hello, Gyan, your favorite number is 9.
=============================================

This is invoked to retrieve input from user.
